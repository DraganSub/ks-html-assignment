        <h3>Summary:</h3>

        <p>
          "Deadpool" is a 2016 superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. The movie follows
          Wade Wilson, a former Special Forces operative turned mercenary, who undergoes an experimental treatment to
          cure his terminal cancer. The procedure grants him accelerated healing powers but leaves him severely scarred
          and mentally unstable.

          Adopting the alter ego "Deadpool," Wade seeks revenge on the man responsible for his condition. As he tracks
          down his nemesis, he engages in chaotic and humorous battles, breaking the fourth wall to address the audience
          directly with witty and self-aware humor.

          "Deadpool" is known for its irreverent and R-rated humor, intense action sequences, and Ryan Reynolds'
          charismatic performance as the wisecracking antihero. The film was a massive success and spawned a sequel,
          "Deadpool 2," and a spin-off film, "Once Upon a Deadpool."
