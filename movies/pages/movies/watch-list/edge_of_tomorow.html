          brink
          of extinction. Tom Cruise stars as William "Bill" Cage, a military officer with no combat experience, who

          day. Trapped in a time loop, he gains the ability to reset each day whenever he dies.

          Cage soon encounters Rita Vrataski, played by Emily Blunt, a skilled soldier renowned for her success in
          killing Mimics. With her help, Cage learns to harness his time-looping ability and gradually becomes a
          formidable warrior.

          As Cage and Rita work together to unravel the secret behind the Mimics' power and find a way to defeat them,
