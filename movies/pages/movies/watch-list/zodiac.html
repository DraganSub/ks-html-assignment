          "Zodiac" is a 2007 mystery thriller film directed by David Fincher. The movie is based on the true story of
          the Zodiac Killer, a notorious serial killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area in the late 1960s and
          early 1970s.

          The film follows a group of journalists and investigators, including Robert Graysmith (played by Jake
          Gyllenhaal), Paul Avery (played by Robert Downey Jr.), and Dave Toschi (played by Mark Ruffalo), who become
          obsessed with solving the Zodiac Killer case.

          As the Zodiac Killer taunts the authorities and media with cryptic letters and ciphers, the team races against
          time to decipher the clues and uncover the killer's identity. Their investigation becomes an all-consuming
          obsession that takes a toll on their personal lives and puts them in danger.

          "Zodiac" is praised for its meticulous attention to detail, compelling storytelling, and the gripping
          performances of its cast. The film captures the fear and paranoia that gripped the Bay Area during the Zodiac
          Killer's reign of terror, and it remains a haunting and suspenseful exploration of one of America's most
          infamous unsolved mysteries.
