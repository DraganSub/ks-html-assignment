        <h3>Plot:</h3>
        <p>Nietzsche was one of the most revolutionary and subversive thinkers in Western philosophy, and Thus Spoke
          Zarathustra remains his most famous and influential work. It describes how the ancient Persian prophet
          Zarathustra descends from his solitude in the mountains to tell the world that God is dead and that the
          Superman, the human embodiment of divinity, is his successor. Nietzsche’s utterance ‘God is dead’, his
          insistence that the meaning of life is to be found in purely human terms, and his doctrine of the Superman and
          the will to power were all later seized upon and unrecognisably twisted by, among others, Nazi intellectuals.
          With blazing intensity and poetic brilliance, Nietzsche argues that the meaning of existence is not to be
          found in religious pieties or meek submission to authority, but in an all-powerful life force: passionate,
          chaotic and free. </p>
