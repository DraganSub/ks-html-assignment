        <h3>Plot:</h3>

        <p>
          "The Outsider" by Stephen King is a thrilling mystery-horror novel that begins with the shocking arrest of a
          respected citizen, Terry Maitland, for the brutal murder of an eleven-year-old boy named Frankie Peterson in
          the town of Flint City, Oklahoma.
        </p>

        <p>
          Detective Ralph Anderson, who leads the investigation, has overwhelming evidence against Maitland, including
          eyewitness accounts and DNA evidence. The case seems open-and-shut, and the town is outraged by the heinous
          crime.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, as the investigation progresses, contradictions arise. Terry Maitland has a solid alibi for the time
          of the murder, with evidence showing he was miles away. This baffling paradox creates doubt in the minds of
          both the detective and the public.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the tension mounts, Detective Anderson delves deeper into the case, uncovering an unimaginable and
          supernatural explanation for the impossible circumstances surrounding the crime. He discovers the existence of
          a shape-shifting entity that feeds on human despair and grief, taking the form of those it victimizes and
          leaving a trail of death and devastation in its wake.
        </p>

        <p>
          Joined by private investigator Holly Gibney, known from King's Bill Hodges Trilogy, they race against time to
          unravel the truth and stop the malevolent entity before it strikes again. As they close in on the creature's
          true nature, they face their own fears and doubts.
        </p>

        <p>
          "The Outsider" explores themes of doubt, the duality of human nature, and the existence of malevolent forces
          lurking within the ordinary. King masterfully blends elements of horror and crime fiction, crafting a gripping
          narrative that keeps readers guessing until the heart-stopping conclusion.
