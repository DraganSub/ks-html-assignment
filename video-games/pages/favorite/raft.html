        <h3>Plot:</h3>

        <p>
          "Raft" is a survival game developed by Redbeet Interactive and published by Axolot Games. It was released in
          2018 and is available on various gaming platforms.
        </p>

        <p>
          In "Raft," players find themselves stranded on a small raft floating in the middle of the ocean. The goal is
          to survive and thrive in this challenging environment by collecting resources, crafting tools and equipment,
          and building and expanding their raft.
        </p>

        <p>
          As players sail across the vast ocean, they must scavenge debris and islands for materials like wood, plastic,
          and scrap to build and upgrade their raft. They also need to secure a steady supply of food and water to avoid
          starvation and dehydration.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, survival in "Raft" is not easy, as players face several challenges, including sharks that attack the
          raft and dangerous weather conditions like storms that threaten to destroy their structures.
        </p>

        <p>
          As players progress, they can research and unlock new technologies to enhance their survival capabilities and
          build more sophisticated structures. The ultimate goal is to explore the ocean, uncover the mysteries it
          holds, and eventually find a way to escape the raft and reach other locations.
