          The game is set in a futuristic world where various heroes, known as "heroes," possess unique abilities and
          come from different backgrounds and countries. Players can choose from a diverse roster of characters, each
          with their own playstyles and roles such as offense, defense, tank, and support.

          The story of "Overwatch" revolves around the organization called Overwatch, which was once a global
          peacekeeping force. After the group disbanded, the world fell into chaos, and conflicts arose between humans
          and intelligent machines called Omnics. Overwatch is reactivated to restore peace and address the growing
          threats.
