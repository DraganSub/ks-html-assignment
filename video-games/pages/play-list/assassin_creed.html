        <h3>Plot:</h3>

        <p>
          "Assassin's Creed Valhalla" is an action role-playing game developed and published by Ubisoft. Released in
          2020, it is the twelfth main installment in the "Assassin's Creed" series.
        </p>

        <p>
          Set in the 9th century, during the Viking Age, "Assassin's Creed Valhalla" follows the journey of Eivor, a
          Viking warrior who becomes the leader of a clan seeking a new home in England. Players can choose to play as
          either male or female Eivor.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eivor's clan, which includes his/her adoptive brother Sigurd, leaves their homeland of Norway and sails to
          England to establish a new settlement. In England, they encounter various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and face both
          opportunities and challenges in their quest for land and prosperity.
        </p>

        <p>
          As Eivor explores the open-world environment of England, players engage in various activities, including
          raiding monasteries, forming alliances, and building and upgrading their settlement, known as Ravensthorpe.
        </p>

        <p>
          The game's narrative revolves around the clash between the Vikings and the hidden order of Assassins, as well
          as the antagonistic Order of the Ancients (predecessors to the Templars).
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout the game, players uncover the mysteries surrounding the First Hidden Blade and the Isu (the ancient
          and advanced civilization that created humanity), all while witnessing Eivor's growth and influence in shaping
          the history of England.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Assassin's Creed Valhalla" is celebrated for its rich historical setting, engaging story, complex characters,
          and immersive world. The game continues the series' tradition of blending historical events and fiction while
          exploring the centuries-long conflict between the Assassins and Templars.
